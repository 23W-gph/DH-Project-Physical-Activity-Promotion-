        <h2> Physical inactivity as a social challenge worldwide</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Recent estimates show that 1.4 billion adults worldwide (27.5% of the global population) 
                do not meet the recommended level of physical activity</li>
        <br>
            <li> More than 80% of the world's adolescent population is insufficiently physically active</li>
        <br>
            <li>Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles
                that requires energy expenditure and can be done at a variety of intensities, and
                accumulated through work, domestic chores, transportation or during leisure time, or
                when participating in sport, walking, cycling, active recreation, and active play</li>
        <br>
            <li> Physical activity has not only an impact on
                individuals and their families, but also on health
                services and society as a whole</li>
        <br>
            <li>wide differences
                in levels of physical activity between regions,
                countries, age groups and sexes do exist</li>
       </ul>

        <h2> Physical activity in the UK</h2>

        <ul>
            <li> A high burden of physical inactivity is also visible in the UK </li>
        <br>
            <li> in the year to November 2022, only 63.1% of people aged 16 and over were physically active</li>
        <br>
            <li>there are also differences between different age groups and ethnic groups</li>
                <P>For example: the percentages of physically active people in the Asian, black, and 'other' ethnic groups were consistently lower than the national average and that people became less active the older they were (72.8% were physically active aged 16-24; 41.2% were physically active aged 75+)</P>  
        </ul>

        <h2> WHO guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour </h2>

        <p>In 2020, the WHO published its guidelines on physical activity, which contain exercise 
            recommendations for different age groups. As our physical activity promotion is mainly 
            aimed at adults, the guidelines for the age group 18-64 are explained:  </p>


        <ul>
            <li>Adults should do at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity 
                aerobic physical activity; or at least 75â€“150 minutes of vigorousintensity 
                aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and 
                vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week, for substantial health benefits. </li>
           <br>
           <li>Adults should also do musclestrengthening activities at
                moderate or greater intensity that
                involve all major muscle groups
                on 2 or more days a week, as these
                provide additional health benefits.</li> 
            <br>
            <li>Adults may increase moderate-intensity
                aerobic physical activity to more than
                300 minutes; or do more than 150
                minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic
                physical activity; or an equivalent
                combination of moderate- and
                vigorous-intensity activity throughout
                the week for additional health benefits.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Adults should limit the amount of time spent
                being sedentary. Replacing sedentary time
                with physical activity of any intensity (including
                light intensity) provides health benefits.</li>
            <br>
            <li> To help reduce the detrimental effects of high
                levels of sedentary behaviour on health, adults
                should aim to do more than the recommended
                levels of moderate- to vigorous-intensity
                physical activity.</li>
